# Editor windows
To create an editor window, you will need to create a HTML file and optionally CSS files to design your UI. You then need to construct a new host container which will also create a new window.

The quickest way to get started would be to checkout the [About window](https://github.com/KaijuEngine/kaiju/blob/master/src/editor/ui/about_window/about_window.go#L58) it's [HTML](https://github.com/KaijuEngine/kaiju/blob/master/content/editor/ui/about_window.html) and [CSS](https://github.com/KaijuEngine/kaiju/blob/master/content/editor/ui/about_window.css) file. It is the simplest example of a window and should give you a good idea of how to create one.
