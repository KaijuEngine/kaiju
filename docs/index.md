# Kaiju Engine
Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. Kaiju comes with it's own modified version of the Go compiler so that optimizations with a focus on real-time games can be made.

## ⚠️ Under heavy development ⚠️
The engine is not released and is under heavy development. Now is a great time to make suggestions and give feedback and be part of the engine development!
