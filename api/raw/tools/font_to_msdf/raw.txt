FUNCTIONS

func ProcessTTF(ttfFile string, charsetFile string) (kaiju_font.KaijuFont, error)
    ProcessTTF will take in a path to a TTF file and a set of characters that
    need to be rendered and generate the engine's proprietary font rendering
    data object. To do this, it uses the open source msdf-atlas-gen executable
    that is packaged with the engine, and generate the .json and .png files,
    then reads the .json file into the kaiju_font.FontData structure. A
    kaiju_font.KaijuFont is returned with the font details and the MSDF version
    of a PNG file.
