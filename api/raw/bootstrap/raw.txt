TYPES

type GameInterface interface {
	// Launch is used to bootstrap a game, the game should fill out this
	// function's details to initialize itself. No updates are provided by the
	// engine, so it is on the the implementing code to take care of registering
	// any udpates with the supplied host.
	Launch(*engine.Host)

	// PluginRegistry is used to expose types to be exported for use in Lua.
	// Any type returned here will have it's members and functions mapped to
	// be called by Lua. You can run the engine with the command line argument
	// "generate=pluginapi" to dump a Lua API file and ensure your exposed
	// types have been correctly inserted.
	PluginRegistry() []reflect.Type

	// ContentDatabase must return the database interface for the engine to use
	// when it is trying to access content. You can use exsiting types that
	// implement [assets.Database], or you can create your own.
	ContentDatabase() (assets.Database, error)
}
    GameInterface is the primary interface to implement in order to bootstrap a
