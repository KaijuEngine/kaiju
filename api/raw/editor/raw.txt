TYPES

type Editor struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Editor is the entry point structure for the entire editor. It acts as the
    delegate to the various systems and holds the primary members that make up
    the bulk of the editor identity.

    The design goal of the editor is different than that of the engine.Host,
    as it is not intended to be passed around for access to the system. Instead
    it will supply interface functions that are needed to the systems that it
    holds internally.
