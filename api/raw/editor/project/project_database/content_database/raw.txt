TYPES

type Cache struct {
	OnBuildFinished events.Event
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Cache is an in-memory cache of all of the content in the project. It keeps
    an internal lookup so that it's quick to look up cached information on an
    asset by it's id. The structure is designed so that it keeps track of when
    it is building internally atomically which is set when the [Build] function
    is called. Removing items from the cache will cause a swap removal which
    means that the ids inside of the lookup are not stable and change with
    removals.

func New() Cache
    New will return a new instance of the cache database with it's members
    pre-sized to an arbitrary amount to speed up initial loading

func (c *Cache) Build(pfs *project_file_system.FileSystem) error
    Build will run through the project's file system config folder and scan
    all of the content configurations in the folder and load them into memory
    as part of the cache. While the build is running, searches and filters
    will work, but [Read] will not (due to it's mapping nature). You can use
    [OnBuildFinished] to know when the build has completed.

func (c *Cache) ChangeGuid(from, to string, pfs *project_file_system.FileSystem) error

func (c *Cache) Index(path string, pfs *project_file_system.FileSystem) error
    Index will insert the given content configuration into the cache. If the
    cache already contains the id for the path, then the cache will replace
    it's currently held values with the new values. This should be called
    when building the cache, importing new content to the project, or when the
    developer changes settings for content that alters the configuration.

func (c *Cache) IndexCachedContent(cc CachedContent)

func (c *Cache) List() []CachedContent
    List will return the internally held cached content slice.

func (c *Cache) ListByType(typeName string) []CachedContent

func (c *Cache) Read(id string) (CachedContent, error)
    Read will try and locate the cached content data by id. This can fail if the
    content is not in the cache, in which case the caller should call [Index]
    to index the file. This can also fail if the cache is currently in the
    process of being built, in which case the caller should wait until it's done
    building and try again, or bind to the [OnBuildFinished] event.

func (c *Cache) ReadLinked(id string) ([]CachedContent, error)
    ReadLinked will return all of the linked content for the given id. This will
    also return the content for the id itself.

func (c *Cache) Remove(id string)
    Remove will delete an entry from the cache (not the config), it is useful
    when content is being deleted from the project. This will delete the entry
    from the lookup as well. Deleting from the lookup makes it unstable since
    removing items from the cache will swap the deleted entry with the last
    entry and resize the length. This once last item will have the index of the
    removed entry and it's lookup will be updated.

func (c *Cache) Rename(id, newName string, pfs *project_file_system.FileSystem) (CachedContent, error)

func (c *Cache) Search(query string) []CachedContent
    Search will filter all content by the given query and return any content
    that matches the query. Currently the only thing that is matched by this
    query is the developer-given name of the content. This is an exact match on
    part or all of the name (case-insensitive), fuzzy search may be introduced
    later.

func (c *Cache) SearchSources(typeName, src string) []CachedContent

func (c *Cache) TagFilter(tags []string) []CachedContent
    TagFilter will filter all content to that which matches the given tags.
    This is an OR comparison so that any content that has at least one of the
    tags will be selected by the filter.

func (c *Cache) TypeFilter(types []string) []CachedContent
    TypeFilter will filter all content to that which matches the given types.
    This is an OR comparison so that any content that has at least one of the
    types will be selected by the filter.

type CachedContent struct {
	// Path is the location in the file system for this cached configuration.
	// You will typically want to use [content_database.ToContentPath] with this
	// path to get the content's location in the content folder.
	Path   string
	Config ContentConfig
}
    CachedContent is the content entry in the cache that is returned from
    lookups and searches.

func (cc CachedContent) ContentPath() string

func (c *CachedContent) Id() string
    CachedContent will read the id from the file name and return it as a string

type CategoryNotFoundError struct {

func (e CategoryNotFoundError) Error() string

type ContentCategory interface {
	// Path returns the singular folder that all of the content of the category
	// will be stored within the file database. This path is relative to the
	// content/config folders. So, the "Texture" category would return "texture"
	// as the path, whereas the "Music" category would return "audio/music".
	Path() string

	// TypeName will return the string-friendly type name that is used to store
	// into the content's config data file. It could be used to test against a
	// specific asset type. It is expected that you can create a ContentCategory
	// instance and use this method without any state, for example:
	// Css{}.TypeName().
	TypeName() string

	// ExtNames will return all of the file extensions that this content
	// category operates on. Many formats need only return a single string here
	// like ".html" for a HTML file, but others may have multiple like ".png",
	// ".jpg", ".jpeg", etc. for the Texture category.
	ExtNames() []string

	// Import will read the source file and extract the relevant data that
	// should be stored in the database. In some cases, this would just return
	// the contents of the file directly. In other cases, this may need to do
	// some processing of the file to extract the relevant information which is
	// contained within (i.e. glTF files).
	Import(src string, fs *project_file_system.FileSystem) (ProcessedImport, error)

	// Reimport will mostly do the same thing as import, however it will also
	// determine if the content can be re-imported. In some cases, like model
	// files, there are multiple pices of content that match up in specific
	// ways. This function will return an error if the re-import isn't possible.
	Reimport(id string, cache *Cache, fs *project_file_system.FileSystem) (ProcessedImport, error)

	// PostImportProcessing allows for any optional post-processing to be done
	// now that the file and all of the dependencies have been imported into the
	// project. This is called for each variant that has been imported. This is
	// useful to do things like creating/importing new materials based on
	// imported mesh files, for example.
	PostImportProcessing(proc ProcessedImport, res *ImportResult, fs *project_file_system.FileSystem, cache *Cache, linkedId string) error
}

	// own folder structure and allows them to control content without
	// physically moving things around.
	Tags klib.Set[string] `json:",omitempty"`

	// Name is a developer-facing friendly name for the content. This is often
	// set to the same name as the asset that was imported. The developer can
	// change it's name at a later time as needed though.
	Name string

	// Type is the type of asset this content is. This will always match
	// ContentCategory.TypeName() and can not be changed by the developer.
	Type string

	// SrcPath is the path to the file that was used to import this content. If
	// the path is within the project folder, then a relative path will be used.
	// If the path is outside of the project folder, an absolute path will be
	// used. This path is not guarenteed to exist, as the developer may have
	// moved or deleted the file.
	SrcPath string

	// SrcName is the name given to this content when it was imported by the
	// source file. This name is not allowed to be changed, it is mainly used
	// for re-importing content.
	SrcName string

	// LinkedId will contain a unique identifier across all content that was
	// linked to a single file import. This field will be empty if there is no
	// other linked content to this one. All content that is linked together
	// will have the same LinkedId.
	LinkedId string `json:",omitempty"`

	Font     *FontConfig     `json:",omitempty"`
	Material *MaterialConfig `json:",omitempty"`
	Mesh     *MeshConfig     `json:",omitempty"`
	Music    *MusicConfig    `json:",omitempty"`
	Sound    *SoundConfig    `json:",omitempty"`
	Texture  *TextureConfig  `json:",omitempty"`
}
    ContentConfig is a composition of all possible configs, identified by
    their matching field name. It also contains some generic developer-facing
    properties.

    The reason that an interface is not used is so that the serialization and
    usage of the various metadata types is simpler to work with, at the cost of
    some extra memory usage per instance.

func ReadConfig(path string, fs *project_file_system.FileSystem) (ContentConfig, error)
    ReadConfig is used to read a config file from the project file system.
    This is primarily used by the cache database, but could be used for other
    needs to extend the editor.

func (c *ContentConfig) AddTag(tag string) (string, bool)
    AddTag is an auxiliary function that will try to add the tag to the config.
    If the config already contains the tag (case insensitive), then it will
    return false. It will also return false if the tag is invalid. In both pass
    and failed cases, it will return the cleaned tag value.

func (c *ContentConfig) NameLower() string
    NameLower is an auxiliary function that simply returns a lowercase version
    of the Name assigned to the config

func (c *ContentConfig) RemoveTag(tag string) bool
    RemoveTag will attempt to locate the tag (case insensitive) and remove it.
    If it finds the tag and removes it, this will return true, otherwise false.
