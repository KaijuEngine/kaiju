TYPES

type Entity struct {
	Transform matrix.Transform
	Parent    *Entity
	Children  []*Entity

	OnDestroy          events.Event
	OnDestroyRequested events.Event
	OnActivate         events.Event
	OnDeactivate       events.Event

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Entity is a struct that represents an arbitrary object in the host system.
    It contains a 3D transformation and can be a parent of, or a child to,
    other entities. Entities can also contain arbitrary named data to make it
    easier to access data that is specific to the entity.

    Child entities are unordered by default, you'll need to call
    #Entity.SetChildrenOrdered to make them ordered. It is recommended to leave
    children unordered unless you have a specific reason to order them.

func NewEntity(workGroup *concurrent.WorkGroup) *Entity
    NewEntity creates a new #Entity struct and returns it

func (e *Entity) Activate()
    Activate will set an active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already active, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) AddNamedData(key string, data any)
    AddNamedData allows you to add arbitrary data to the entity that can be
    accessed by a string key. This is useful for storing data that is specific
    to the entity.

    Named data is stored in a map of slices, so you can add multiple pieces of
    data to the same key. It is recommended to compile the data into a single
    structure so the slice length is 1, but sometimes that's not reasonable.

func (e *Entity) ChildAt(idx int) *Entity
    ChildAt returns the child entity at the specified index

func (e *Entity) ChildCount() int
    ChildCount returns the number of children the entity has

func (e *Entity) Copy(other *Entity)

func (e *Entity) Deactivate()
    Deactivate will set an active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already inactive, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) DestroyShaderData()

func (e *Entity) Duplicate(workGroup *concurrent.WorkGroup) *Entity

func (e *Entity) FindByName(name string) *Entity
    FindByName will search the entity and the tree of children for the first
    entity with the specified name. If no entity is found, nil will be returned.

func (e *Entity) ForceCleanup()
    ForceCleanup will force the full cleanup of the entity, typically this is to
    be called in very specific scenarios and not directly in game code. Unless
    there is a good reason (like this entity no longer bein gin the host).

func (e *Entity) HasChildRecursive(child *Entity) bool

func (e *Entity) HasChildren() bool
    HasChildren returns true if the entity has any children

func (e *Entity) HasParent(parent *Entity) bool
    HasParent will loop through each parent and determine if any of them is the
    parent Entity supplied. If so, then it will return true, false otherwise.

func (e *Entity) Id() EntityId
    ID returns the unique identifier of the entity. The Id is only valid for
    entities that are not generated through template instantiation. The Id may
    also be stripped during game runtime if the entity is never externally
    referenced by any other part of the system.

func (e *Entity) IndexOfChild(child *Entity) int

func (e *Entity) Init(workGroup *concurrent.WorkGroup)

func (e *Entity) IsActive() bool
    IsActive will return true if the entity is active, false otherwise

func (e *Entity) IsDestroyed() bool
    IsDestroyed will return true if the entity is destroyed, false otherwise

func (e *Entity) IsRoot() bool
    IsRoot returns true if the entity is the root entity in the hierarchy

func (e *Entity) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the entity

func (e *Entity) NamedData(key string) []any
    NamedData will return the data associated with the specified key. If the key
    does not exist, nil will be returned.

func (e *Entity) RemoveNamedData(key string, data any)
    RemoveNamedData will remove the specified data from the entity's named data
    map. If the key does not exist, this function will do nothing.

    *This will remove the entire slice and all of it's data*

func (e *Entity) RemoveNamedDataByName(key string)
    RemoveNamedDataByName will remove all of the stored named data that matches
    the given key on the entity

func (e *Entity) Root() *Entity
    Root will return the root entity of the entity's hierarchy

func (e *Entity) SetActive(isActive bool)
    SetActive will set the active flag on the entity that can be queried with
    #Entity.IsActive. It will also set the active flag on all children of the
    entity. If the entity is already active, this function will do nothing.

func (e *Entity) SetChildrenOrdered()
    SetChildrenOrdered sets the children of the entity to be ordered

func (e *Entity) SetChildrenUnordered()
    SetChildrenUnordered sets the children of the entity to be unordered

func (e *Entity) SetName(name string)
    SetName sets the name of the entity

func (e *Entity) SetParent(newParent *Entity)
    SetParent will set the parent of the entity. If the entity already has
    a parent, it will be removed from the parent's children list. If the new
    parent is nil, the entity will be removed from the hierarchy and will become
    the root entity. If the new parent is not nil, the entity will be added to
    the new parent's children list. If the new parent is not active, the entity
    will be deactivated as well.

    This will also handle the transformation parenting internally

func (e *Entity) ShaderData() rendering.DrawInstance

func (e *Entity) StoreShaderData(sd rendering.DrawInstance)

type EntityData interface {
	Init(entity *Entity, host *Host)
}

type EntityId string

    The identifier is only valid for entities that are not generated through
    template instantiation. The identifier may also be stripped during game
    runtime if the entity is never externally referenced by any other part of
    the system.

type FrameId = uint64
    FrameId is a unique identifier for a frame

}
    Host is the mediator to the entire runtime for the game/editor. It is the
    main entry point for the game loop and is responsible for managing all
    entities, the window, and the rendering context. The host can be used to
    create and manage entities, call update functions on the main thread,
    and access various caches and resources.

    The host is expected to be passed around quite often throughout the program.
    It is designed to remove things like service locators, singletons, and other
    global state. You can have multiple hosts in a program to isolate things
    like windows and game state.

func NewHost(name string, logStream *logging.LogStream, assetDb assets.Database) *Host
    NewHost creates a new host with the given name and log stream. The log
    stream is the log handler that is used by the slog package functions. A Host
    that is created through NewHost has no function until #Host.Initialize is
    called.

func (host *Host) Render()
    Render will render the scene. This starts by preparing any drawings that
    are pending. It also creates any pending shaders, textures, and meshes
    before the start of the render. The frame is then readied, buffers swapped,
    and any transformations that are dirty on entities are then cleaned.

    rate is reached before continuing the update loop.

func (host *Host) SetGame(game any)
    SetGame is to be called by the engine in most cases. It is called by the
    editor when it first starts up to setup the editor game binding. For a game
    generated by the editor, it will be called when the game is bootstrapped and
    provide the *game_host.GameHost structure. You can call this function at any
    time you want, but you really only should need to for special cases.

    added to UIUpdater [-] UILateUpdate: Functions added to UILateUpdater
    [-] Update: Functions added to Updater [-] LateUpdate: Functions added to
    LateUpdater [-] EndUpdate: Internal functions for preparing for the next
    frame

    top to bottom and calls each function.

    *Note that update functions are unordered, so don't rely on the order*

func NewConcurrentUpdater(threads *concurrent.Threads) Updater
    NewConcurrentUpdater creates a new concurrent #Updater struct and returns it

func NewUpdater() Updater
    NewUpdater creates a new #Updater struct and returns it

func (u *Updater) AddUpdate(update func(float64)) UpdateId
    AddUpdate adds an update function to the list of updates to be called when
    the #Updater.Update function is called. It returns the id of the update
    function that was added so that it can be removed later.

    The update function is added to a back-buffer so it will not begin updating
    until the next call to #Updater.Update.

func (u *Updater) Destroy()

func (u *Updater) RemoveUpdate(id *UpdateId)
    RemoveUpdate removes an update function from the list of updates to be
    called when the #Updater.Update function is called. It takes the id of the
    update function that was returned when the update function was added.

    The update function is removed from a back-buffer so it will not be removed
    until the next call to #Updater.Update.

func (u *Updater) Update(deltaTime float64)
    Update calls all of the update functions that have been added to the
    updater. It takes a deltaTime parameter that is the approximate amount of
    time since the last call to #Updater.Update.
