				Kaiju is an open source, general purpose, 2D/3D game engine originally developed by Brent Farris with help from Brett Faulds. Our primary focus is on Vulkan, HTML/CSS UI, and as few dependencies on 3rd party packages/libraries as possible. Please review our GitHub repository for more information on the project and how to contribute. Click anywhere on this text to view the repository contributors.
