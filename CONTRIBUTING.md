2. If you didn't find the bug, report it via issues with bug tag

#### **Pull requeset rules**
1. You must make a pull request to the `staging` branch
2. Title must be short and self explanitory
3. Give a detailed description of the change, why it was made, and what it solves

- In your video, the text/code must be legible
- Maximum video quality is 1080p 30fps

- Time stamps for major parts of the process would be appreciated, but not required
- Pause recordings or cut out useless sections of video that don't present any meaningful insight or process
	- Example: You reading a web page or watching a video to learn something
		- You can just summarize or reference what you used for reference
